📚 Lesson 1: Introduction to lionagi
────────────────────────────────────

Welcome to lionagi! Let's start with the basics.

lionagi is an AI orchestration framework that helps you build 
intelligent systems by managing AI model interactions.

🔑 Key Concept: Branch
A Branch is the core component that manages AI conversations.

Example:
\`\`\`python
from lionagi import Branch, iModel

# Create a branch
branch = Branch(
    system="You are a helpful assistant",
    chat_model=iModel(provider="openai", model="gpt-4")
)

# Communicate with AI
response = await branch.communicate("Hello!")
\`\`\`

📝 Quick Check: What is the main component for managing AI conversations?
Type your answer> 

[If you answer "Branch" correctly, you get +10 points and continue to Lesson 2]
[Lesson 2 teaches about iModel and AI providers]

Welcome to the interactive lionagi code playground!
Here you can practice lionagi syntax and get instant feedback.

🎯 Try typing some lionagi code patterns:
• branch creation
• model configuration  
• communication
• tools

Type 'examples' to see code examples
Type 'menu' to return to main menu

[You can then type lionagi code and get feedback like:]
[✅ Great! You're using Branch - the core component.]
[💡 Branch manages AI conversations and maintains context.]

The interactive platform is now running in the background.
You can interact with it by opening a new terminal and running:

echo "1" | node start-platform.js

Or better yet, let's try the real lionagi examples with your Python environment!

🚀 WANT TO TRY REAL LIONAGI?
═══════════════════════════

Since you have your Python environment set up with API keys,
let's run some actual lionagi code:

`);

// Offer real lionagi demo
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(`
🔥 Ready for real lionagi action? 
Run this command to see actual AI responses:

python examples/lionagi_walkthrough.py

This will show you:
✅ Real AI conversations
✅ Multiple model comparisons  
✅ Structured responses
✅ Practical coding examples
✅ Tool integration demos

The learning platform teaches you the concepts,
but this shows you lionagi working with real AI models!
